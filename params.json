StokesDT is written in C++ and is optimized for x86-based multicore and Intel MIC-based manycore architectures.\r\n\r\n# Highlights #\r\n  * Uses SPME for computing long range hydrodynamic interactions.\r\n  * Uses Lanczos for computing Brownian displacements.\r\n  * Computes bonded forces and steric forces.\r\n  * Can use GPU and Intel Xeon Phi accelerators.\r\n  * Provides a flexible, object-oriented user interface which can be used to develop customized hydrodynamic simulation codes.\r\n  * Matlab interface available.\r\n\r\n# News #\r\n  * StokesDT v0.3.0 has been released. [Downloads](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/stokesdt-v0.3.0.tgz).\r\n  * StokesDT v0.2.0 has been released. [Downloads](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~xliu66/stokesdt/stokesdt-v0.2.0.tgz).\r\n  * StokesDT v0.1.0 has been released.
